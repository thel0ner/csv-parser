# csv-parser
 This is a simple CSV parser which parses the provided CSV file, and generates a new one which contains combination count of target file.

 This script is written in pure PHP and does not require anything rather than PHP itself :)

 in order to get it to work, simply run the following command:

 ```
php parser.php --file ./examples/products_comma_separated-small.csv --unique-combinations ./test.csv

 ```

 Where --file is the target file and --unique-combinations is for the output.
